Data related assignment: vampire guesses are done by three different data preprocesssing choices made by user

1. Thresholding
2. Guessing 
3. Decision trees (extra credit)

Model - model is developed based on the choice of the user on which data preprocessing step to use. The pie chart is developed in example 24 within drawchart() and he shows an example of counting the number of vampires based on whether they had a show or not. .The vampires are counted in the classmate_data_processing() function. 

View -  Will need to display chart based on the data preprocessing method chosen

Controller - I will need to create a drop down with different data preprocessing options, the selection will call a preprocessing function like example . Will also need to display a table of current students and give the user the option of adding new students, editing students, and deleting students. Will need to create a function to append to data..
